# Audio event detection
The script is modified from [](https://github.com/craigfrancis/audio-detect).\
I removed most of the code, there's just a single line terminal output with the progress.\
It exits when the first match happens and override the timestamp with zeros if no match is found.
## Installation
```install -D -m 755 <(curl -fsSL git.io/JTUWM) ~/.local/bin/getlogotime```
## Usage
```getlogotime input logo```
The inputs can be any file with an audio in it that ffmpeg can process.\
The logo can be a file or a folder containing files.
## Examples
`getlogotime input.mp2 introsound.wav`
`getlogotime input.ac3 logofolder`
